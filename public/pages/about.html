    		<p class="quote">
    			I believe in honest, useful and intuitive design that helps solve business goals and makes it easy and delightful for the user to navigate and experience the website or app. <br>I believe that beautiful aesthetics that matches the brand- or campaign-story adds value and makes everything more enjoyable. <br>I believe that the devil is in the details and that the details can make or break a design. <br>I believe that a great story and integrity towards the vision of the brand or project can make the world of difference. <br>I believe... I believe in having fun, trying to learn and evolve, and that success is more fun if you have a team to share it with.

    		<h1>ABOUT</h1>
    		<p>
                I'm an easy going and ambitious digital creative. Originally from Denmark, but now living and working in Stockholm, Sweden, as a Senior Designer at <a href="http://www.northkingdom.com/" target="_blank">North Kingdom</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have a big passion for creating useful and beautiful stuff, while constantly trying to learn and improve in the process. Besides from that Iâ€™m quite interested in behavioural economics and persuasion psychology, and how that relates to our trade and the world in general.
            </p>

            <p>
                I truly love snowboarding and other physical challenges where I can push myself, stay fit, and clear my mind. Whether that's running and going to the gym, or, when traveling and experiencing new things like diving or climbing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Before I moved to Stockholm I worked at Jack &amp; Jones in Denmark, where I lead a small team focused on a variety of projects that highlighted the brand values and goals, while improving the overall experience for our users.  That has led me to working with a lot of various things such as: Major brand campaigns, E-Commerce, Mobile, Newsletters, Copywriting, IA, UX etc.
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2009 a had a short, but great, stint New York City where I had an internship at MW Design Interactive(a digital design boutique) as the final part of my education as a Multimedia Designer.
