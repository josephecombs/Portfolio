    		<h1>ABOUT</h1>
    		<p>
                I am a person who is interested in all aspects of information technology.  I believe that the greatest things ever will be the product of the efforts of people in this field.

				I studied Economics at Georgetown University and retain an interest in bringing market forces (aka intelligence) to previously unintelligent marketplaces, in addition to Economics generally.

				I recently finished a web development bootcamp, <a href="http://www.appacademy.io">App Academy</a>, in San Francisco.  I blogged about it <a href="http://josephecombs.tumblr.com">here</a>.  This was one of the hardest things I have done, and I definitely learned a lot.

                Before I moved to Stockholm I worked at Jack &amp; Jones in Denmark, where I lead a small team focused on a variety of projects that highlighted the brand values and goals, while improving the overall experience for our users.  That has led me to working with a lot of various things such as: Major brand campaigns, E-Commerce, Mobile, Newsletters, Copywriting, IA, UX etc.
