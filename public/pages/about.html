    		<h1>ABOUT</h1>
    		<p>
                I am a person who is interested in all aspects of information technology.  I believe that the greatest things ever will be the product of the efforts of people in this field.  This is a very special time in human history and I am thrilled to be a part of it.  
            </p>

            <p>
				I studied Economics at Georgetown University and I continue to be interested in that field.  I felt, however, that I could bring more value to the world by making software and making things more efficient generally.  I enjoy making software that, pardon the cliche, makes a difference.

            <p>
				I recently finished a web development bootcamp, <a href="http://www.appacademy.io">App Academy</a>, in San Francisco.  I blogged about it <a href="http://josephecombs.tumblr.com">here</a>.  This was one of the hardest things I have done, and I definitely learned a lot.  My knowledge prior was learned both on-the-job and by myself.  App Academy has brought clarity and skill to areas where I previously felt less skilled.

            <p>
				Before completing App Academy, I worked at <a href="http://www.mtagservices.com">MTAG Services</a>, first as an Analyst in their Acquisitions Department, and then as a (junior) Software Developer in their Information Technology Department.  MTAG is a financial servicer and I hope to one day return to the financial services field in some capacity.  Their business is very complex and niche, and in my time there I came to mostly understand this complexity.  I would not necessarily be daunted to see a large codebase or org chart or process diagram again. Please see <a href="/Joseph_Combs_Resume.pdf">my CV</a> (pdf) for more information on my background.

    			Here are some things I am interested in, in no particular order: machine vision, web development, web scraping, cloud services, progressive house music, business process diagramming, mobile computing, google glass, and of course, <a href="http://twitter.com/josephcombs">tweeting</a> and <a href="http://josephecombs.tumblr.com">blogging</a> about these topics.
