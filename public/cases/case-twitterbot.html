        <h1>Friendly Paywall Destroyer Robot</h1>
        <p class="live">Live bot (currently suspended!): <a href="http://www.twitter.com/wallcrusherbot" target="_blank">http://www.twitter.com/wallcrusherbot</a></p>
        <p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>Have you ever hated annoying paywalled articles that you get links to?  This bot is the solution!  This bot uses the Ruby <a href="https://github.com/tweetstream/tweetstream">tweetstream</a> project to create a twitter client that listens to new tweets by the mothership twitter accounts of major organizations like @TheEconomist, @nytimes, @FT, etc.  It then uses the ruby nokogiri and mechanize gems to inspect the link inside the tweet and extract the headline elements from the article.  It then constructs the correct google query that will make the article the first result.  It then replies to the original tweet with this link to google results, making a tedious process for the user much simpler - .i.e. that of manually selecting text in iOS, manually opening a browser, and manually pasting that text into a google query.<br><br>
			
<span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>The bot is banned right now but it was a fun exercise anyways, and hopefully I can overturn the ban.  The project uses metaprogramming patterns to allow me to extend the solution easily - i.e. add a key/value to a configuration hash, and a method with appropriate css selectors named according to a certain convention.  The core logic of the program does not know the names of the methods it is going to call, basically, until runtime.  I wanted to do automated deployment to a micro AWS instance but Twitter suspended me first so the project is on hold right now. <br><br>

<span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>	I would like to operate more bots using this concept later.  Say, I could monitor twitter for people who are repeating lies, and reply to the lies with a refutation link.  Or I could monitor twitter for people who tweet strings containing economic fallacies and reply with the rebuttals.  There are great existing examples of this such as the <a href="https://twitter.com/your_grammar">grammar correction robot</a>.
